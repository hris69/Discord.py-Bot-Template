# Python Discord Bot Template
A discord.py Discord bot template
Python 3.5.3 or higher is  for discord.py required

## How to install all packages and configure your bot
To start the bot you need to go to the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. Copy the token and insert it in the .env file, of course you need code too!
* Invite your bot in your server with this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=your_id_here&scope=bot&permissions=8
* Replace the **your_id_here** with your application ID.
* After you did that, you need to install all the required packages for your bot!

Install all the requirements with this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to setup .env file
in this .env file paste your token in it and it automatically will be changed 
Remember: Never give your token to anyone, they can do bad things with it! Treat it like a important password!
The .env is here for you to secure your token
